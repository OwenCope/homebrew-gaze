# Homebrew cask for Gaze. Lives in a tap repository named `homebrew-gaze`
# (github.com/OwenCope/homebrew-gaze, file Casks/gaze.rb), so people install with:
#
#     brew install --cask owencope/gaze/gaze
#
# Gaze is not notarized, so macOS would block the first launch. The postflight
# clears the quarantine flag on install and on every upgrade, which is what the
# manual `xattr` step in the README does. Homebrew's official cask repository
# only accepts notarized apps, which is why this is a separate tap.
